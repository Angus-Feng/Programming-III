        port: 1025,
        // other settings...
    });

**Django** -- Add `EMAIL_PORT = 1025` in your settings file [[source]](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-EMAIL_PORT)

**Rails** -- config settings:

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
        config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {

## Ideas

If you're using MailDev and you have a great idea, I'd love to hear it. If you're not using MailDev because it lacks a feature, I'd love to hear that too. Add an issue to the repo [here](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/issues/new) or contact me on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/djfarrelly).

## Contributing

Any help on MailDev would be awesome. There is plenty of room for improvement. Feel free to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev/issues/new) from small to big changes. 

To run **MailDev** during development:

    # grunt-cli is needed by grunt; ignore this if already installed
    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt dev

The `grunt dev` task will run the project using nodemon and restart automatically when changes are detected. SASS files will be compiled automatically on save also. To trigger some emails for testing run `node test/send.js` in a separate shell. Please run jshint to your lint code before submitting a pull request; run `grunt jshint`.
